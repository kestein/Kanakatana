Each quest has a 'endQuest' function (usually @ the end of the page)
In player, create an array for the available abilities
In the 'endQuest' function, add the ability gained from the quest into the player array full of available abilities
also add the button to the hud (hud_g for that file)
	we can do cycling for a later deliverable
